## Problem description

A “hand” in poker consists of five playing cards drawn from a standard deck. Implement a system which can decide which of two hands has the highest ranking, according to the standard poker ranking rules.

## Video

TBA

## After the video

1) Finish implementing all the poker hands
in a "shameless green" style

2) Address the ```##DUPE! pip_count``` comment
the ```pip_count``` and ```suit_count``` methods are essentially duplicates of each other

3) Address the ```##bob``` comment
##bob is a slightly silly notation I use when I have a method/class/variable with a name that does not please me (not descriptive enough, actually wrong, any possibility for confusion) but I can't think of a better name at time of writing
In this case ```pip_count``` and ```suit_count``` don't describe the intention of those methods
