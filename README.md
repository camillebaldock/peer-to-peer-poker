# Peer to Peer: poker ranking

### [Watch the video](http://peertopeer.io/a/cb1/)

I was the second guest on Drew Neil’s [Peer to Peer interview series](http://peertopeer.io/h/cb1/), hosted by [Tom Stuart](http://codon.com). I was given me a programming problem about poker card-ranking. Tom Stuart sat by me and asked me questions about how I was approaching things as I worked on the problem. I had lots of fun making that video: you can [watch the episode here](http://peertopeer.io/a/cb1/).

# Problem description

A “hand” in poker consists of five playing cards drawn from a standard deck. Implement a system which can decide which of two hands has the highest ranking, according to the standard poker ranking rules.

# Solving the problem

Annotations and explanations of my though process and compromises are [available here](http://camillebaldock.co.uk/notes-on-poker-ranking/). 

On the ```master``` branch you will see where I left things off at the end of session. 

On the ```bonus``` branch you will find further work done to complete the problem and refactor some of the code.
