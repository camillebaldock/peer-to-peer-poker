## Problem description

A “hand” in poker consists of five playing cards drawn from a standard deck. Implement a system which can decide which of two hands has the highest ranking, according to the standard poker ranking rules.

## Video

TBA

## After the video

1) Finish implementing all the poker hands
in a "shameless green" style

2) Address the ```##DUPE! pip_count``` comment
the ```pip_count``` and ```suit_count``` methods are essentially duplicates of each other
